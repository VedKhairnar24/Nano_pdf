Detailed Prompt: Modern Python PDF Password Remover with GUI
Role: Senior Python Developer & UI/UX Designer Task: Create a secure, modern desktop application that allows users to remove passwords from PDF files using a known password.

1. Core Functionality
The application must perform the following critical operations:

File Import: Open a native system dialog to browse and select a .pdf file.

Secure Verification: Accept a user-provided password and verify it against the PDF before attempting any save operations.

Decryption: Create a new copy of the PDF that is fully decrypted (password removed).

File Export: Trigger a "Save As" dialog allowing the user to specify the destination and filename for the unlocked file.

Data Integrity: Ensure the original source file remains 100% modified.

2. UI/UX Design Specifications
Framework: Use customtkinter (preferred) for a modern, high-DPI aware look, or PyQt6. Do not use standard Tkinter unless heavily styled.

Layout & Components:

Header:

Title: "PDF Password Remover" (Bold, centered).

File Selection:

A read-only entry field displaying the selected file path (Placeholder: "No file selected").

A "Browse" button placed to the right.

Password Entry:

Label: "PDF Password".

Input Field: Masked characters (* or •) for security.

Toggle: A small "Show/Hide" check button or icon.

Action Button:

A prominent "Remove Password" button (Accent Color: Blue #3B8ED0 or Green #2CC985).

State: Disabled by default; enabled only when a file is selected and password field is not empty.

Feedback System:

Status Bar: Located at the bottom.

Success: "File unlocked and saved successfully!" (Green text).

Error: Specific error messages like "Incorrect Password" or "File Corrupted" (Red text).

Processing: A simple progress bar or "Processing..." label during the operation.

Styling:

Theme: System default (Auto-match Light/Dark mode).

Spacing: Consistent padding (10-20px) between elements to avoid clutter.

Typography: Clean sans-serif fonts (e.g., Roboto, Segoe UI).

3. Technical Implementation
PDF Engine: Use pikepdf (preferred for reliability with modern encryption) or PyPDF2.

Concurrency: Run the file processing logic in a separate thread to ensure the GUI remains responsive (does not freeze) during decryption.

Architecture:

Separate logic from UI (e.g., a PDFController class for logic and App class for GUI).

Use try/except blocks to handle:

pikepdf.PasswordError (Wrong password).

FileNotFoundError.

PermissionError (If output file is open).

4. Security & Ethical Constraints
Validation: The app must fail if the user provides the wrong password.

No Cracking: Strictly no brute-force or dictionary attack algorithms.

Privacy: No data should be sent to external servers; all processing must happen locally.

5. Deliverables
Complete Source Code: A single, runnable .py script.

Dependencies: A comment block listing required libraries (e.g., pip install customtkinter pikepdf).

Comments: detailed docstrings explaining the decryption logic.
